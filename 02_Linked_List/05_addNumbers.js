/*
You have two nubers represeted by a linked list, where each node contains a signle digit.  The digits are stroed in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list.  Write a funtion that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

Example
input: ( 7 -> 1 -> 6 ) + ( 5 -> 9 -> 2 ). that is 617 + 295
output: ( 2 -> 1 -> 9 ). that is 912

FOLLOW UP
suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Pepeat the above problem.
Example
input: ( 6 -> 1 -> 7 ) + ( 2 -> 9 -> 5 ). that is 617 + 295
output: ( 9 -> 1 -> 2 ). that is 912
what if the two numbers have different digits
