/*
Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which return the node at the begining of the loop.

DEFINITION
Circular linked list: A(corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list. 

EXAMPLE
Input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
Ouput: C
